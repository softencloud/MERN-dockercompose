In this lab you'll learn how to dockerize a MERN application (for development). 
You'll learn about docker networks, volumes, port mapping, and more.
A docker compose file enables us to pack the configuration of multiple containers in one place and 
enables us to build multiple images, their network and containers.



Docker compose
: tool for defining & running multi-container docker applications
: use yaml files to configure application services (docker-compose.yml)
: can start all services with a single command : docker compose up
: can stop all services with a single command : docker compose down
: can scale up selected services when required

Step 1 : install docker compose
   (already installed on windows and mac with docker)
   docker-compose -v

Step 2 : Create docker compose file at any location on your system
   docker-compose.yml

Step 3 : Check the validity of file by command
    docker-compose config

Step 4 : Run docker-compose.yml file by command
   docker-compose up -d

Steps 5 : Bring down application by command
   docker-compose down
